## Running the program

As of right now, we do not have JAR builds and thus must test the program by clicking the *RUN* icon in IntelliJ. When you click run, a GUI should pop up that lets you click a selection of buttons.

**NOTE**  
The project is still incomplete so the program will most likely freeze. To exit the applicaton, click the *STOP* button on IntelliJ.
